This lab provides practice scenarios to help prepare you for the 
Certified Kubernetes Application Developer (CKAD) exam. You will be presented 
with tasks to complete, as well as server(s) and/or an existing Kubernetes cluster
to complete them in. You will need to use your knowledge of Kubernetes 
to successfully complete the provided tasks, much like you would on the real CKAD exam. 
Good luck!
